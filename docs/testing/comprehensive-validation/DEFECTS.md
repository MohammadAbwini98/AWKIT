# AWKIT Comprehensive Validation Defects

## Open product defect

### AWKIT-E2E-001 — Flow-level `manualApproval` connector is silently ignored

- **Severity:** S2 / Major
- **Priority recommendation:** P1 before declaring the complete flow-routing model ready
- **Status:** Open / reproducible
- **Affected area:** `src/runner/FlowExecutor.ts`, `FlowExecutor.resolveNext`
- **Detected by:** `CMP-CON-002`
- **Evidence:** `test-artifacts/comprehensive-e2e/2026-07-25T21-27-41-429Z/campaign-results.json`

**Preconditions**

- A flow contains a `manualHandoff` node.
- Its only outgoing edge has type `manualApproval` and targets End.
- The authorized controller resumes the handoff.

**Reproduction**

1. Run the test profile constructed by `runFlowManualApprovalConnector` in `scripts/verify-comprehensive-e2e.mts`.
2. Wait until the manual handoff pauses.
3. Resume it through the test handoff controller.
4. Inspect the returned flow status and executed node IDs.

**Actual result**

- The flow returns `passed`.
- The Manual Handoff node completes.
- The target End node never executes.
- The path terminates silently because `resolveNext` has routing precedence for outcome, conditional, loop-back, success, always, and legacy `next`, but no flow-level `manualApproval` case.

**Expected result**

- After explicit approval/resume, the `manualApproval` edge is selected.
- End executes.
- The flow reports `passed` only after reaching the terminal node.

**Impact**

- A designer can persist a supported connector that the runtime does not follow.
- Downstream actions may be skipped while the run is reported successful.
- Reports can therefore state success for an incomplete business process.

**Suggested fix**

Treat an outgoing `manualApproval` edge as eligible only after a manual/protected handoff has actually resumed, then add a regression asserting the exact executed-node sequence and terminal End. Do not globally treat it as an ordinary success edge, because that could bypass the approval semantic.

## Resolved validation-harness defects

These were found and corrected while building the campaign. They are not open AWKIT product defects.

### HARNESS-001 — Concurrency verifier used removed failure-capture hook

- **Symptom:** `verify:concurrency` crashed before assertions.
- **Cause:** Stub implemented `captureFailureScreenshot` while the runner now calls `captureFailureEvidence`.
- **Resolution:** Updated the verifier stub.
- **Verification:** `verify:concurrency` passed 78/78.

### HARNESS-002 — Packaged walkthrough selected splash window

- **Symptom:** Packaged checks attempted to call the preload bridge on the splash window.
- **Resolution:** Resolve the main window by probing for the packaged preload API.

### HARNESS-003 — Packaged walkthrough lacked current authentication precondition

- **Symptom:** Flow imports returned `NOT_AUTHORIZED`.
- **Resolution:** Provision/log in to a synthetic local first-run account within each fresh temporary profile.
- **Security note:** This is local test setup, not an MFA/CAPTCHA/SSO bypass.

### HARNESS-004 — Long Wait fixture violated current validation contract

- **Symptom:** The run returned `validationFailed`; no execution ID existed.
- **Cause:** Wait duration was set only as `timeoutMs`, while the exhaustive step requirements require Wait to carry a value/value source.
- **Resolution:** Persist `"120000"` as a static value and retain `timeoutMs` as the step timeout.

### HARNESS-005 — Packaged concurrency assumed dedicated-browser slots

- **Symptom:** Four instances and two browser roots ran, but `activeSlots` remained zero and no instances queued.
- **Cause:** Current shared-browser mode represents instances as virtual context slots; `activeSlots` deliberately counts only dedicated real-browser slots. Four contexts may be multiplexed over the two-root browser cap.
- **Resolution:** Observe active instance/context slots and OS browser roots, asserting four isolated instances over no more than two roots.

### HARNESS-006 — Fresh-profile/report assertions were stale or racy

- **Symptoms:** The harness expected a bundled sample workflow on a deliberately empty fresh profile and checked the report before asynchronous persistence completed.
- **Resolution:** Assert absence of developer/mock leftovers and poll for the report for up to 10 seconds.

## Environmental gaps, not defects

- Live Oracle: blocked because no approved URL/user/password is configured and the local Oracle container is absent.
- Oracle packaged driver bundle: local development offline validation reported a zero-megabyte Oracle bundle warning; release packaging remains an explicit readiness gate.
- Clean/offline Windows VM walkthrough: not run.
- CAPTCHA/MFA/OTP/protected-login completion: intentionally blocked for authorized manual handoff.
- Firefox/WebKit certification: not run under this Chromium-first scope.
