# L1 — AI Foundation, Autonomy Policy & Performance Gate

Shared rules, architecture and decisions: `ROADMAP.md`. Depends on L0.

## Goal

Build the single optional AI boundary, the autonomy/audit machinery every AI feature uses, and prove the model is
viable on constrained CPU **before** any AI feature is built.

## Tasks

### L1.1 AiService host
- Long-lived utility/stdio child process (no TCP listener). If `llama-server` is unavoidable: loopback only,
  random ephemeral port, per-session random token, reject non-loopback.
- Pattern lifecycle on `ZvecUtilityHostManager` + `ZvecHostRestartPolicy` (lazy restart, circuit breaker, clean shutdown).
- States: `available | unavailable(reason) | loading | busy | error(code)`.
- One job queue: request/feature id, priority, timeout, cancellation, bounded length, one inference at a time,
  bounded prompt/output tokens.
- Renderer gets narrow feature APIs only (pattern: `SemanticApi.ts` drops unknown properties).

### L1.2 Model pack
- Settings import: select file → format/identity check → SHA-256 vs manifest → copy under data root → register.
- Status: Installed / Missing / Invalid / Incompatible; remove/replace behind permission.
- Pin llama.cpp revision; add model/runtime license and third-party notices.

### L1.3 Output contract
- Thinking disabled for all product prompts; grammar/JSON-schema constrained decoding; runtime schema validation
  after decoding; reject unknown IDs/operations even in valid JSON.
- Prompt builder separates instructions from delimited untrusted data; per-field and total caps; IDs/enums over text;
  central redaction (`SecretMasker`, `SemanticRedactor`) before every request; no raw prompt/response persistence.

### L1.4 Autonomy policy & audit (new, shared by L3–L6)
- Pure `AiAutonomyPolicy`: `(feature, actionClass, context) → observe | suggest | autoApply | forbidden`.
  T3 action classes hard-coded forbidden; configured tiers capped at T2.
- `AiActionRecord` store (atomic writes via `app/main/atomicReplace.ts`): action, target, evidence IDs, proof result,
  model id, tier, timestamp, revert handle, reverted flag.
- Revert API restores the prior value through the owning save path.
- Self-demotion: revert rate per feature over a rolling window > committed threshold ⇒ T2→T1 + notice.

### L1.5 Permissions & Settings
- Decide each permission explicitly in `Permissions.ts` for every built-in role (Administrator is a denylist):
  use AI, manage AI/model pack, view AI audit/diagnostics, Element Spy.
- Settings: master switch; model-pack status; per-feature tier selector (bounded by policy); yield-during-runs
  (default ON); idle unload; runtime/model/checksum status; audit log view with revert. No cloud fields.

### L1.6 Resource integration
- Register inference in `WorkloadWeights`; admission via `AdaptiveController`/`BackpressureController`.
- Threads derived from `MachineCapabilityDetector` (3–4 on the target envelope), never hardcoded.
- Queued jobs pause while runs are active; never preempt Playwright-critical work; idle unload.

### L1.7 Fake provider
- Deterministic fake transport (pattern: `FakeZvecHostTransport`) scripted per test; all normal verifiers use it.

### L1.8 Performance go/no-go
Constrained 6-logical-CPU harness (not a VMware claim). Measure load time, RSS/peak, prompt tokens/s, generation
tokens/s, TTFT, cancellation latency, CPU, Recorder responsiveness, Playwright impact (queued/active/yielded) for:
1. locator semantic-upgrade job (≤~2K in / ≤192 out, ≤2 attempts);
2. replay-proof path (no model — confirms zero cost);
3. validation explanation (≤~1.5K / ≤192);
4. post-run failure analysis (≤~2K / ≤256);
5. coalesced concurrent-failure batch incl. queue-cap/budget exhaustion.

Record per-feature budgets from results. If unacceptable after tuning, mark L3/L4b/L5b **BLOCKED pending model/runtime
decision**.

## Verifiers

`verify:ai-adapter`, `verify:ai-redaction`, `verify:ai-fallback`, `verify:ai-permissions`, `verify:ai-model-pack`,
`verify:ai-autonomy-policy` (tier matrix, T3 unreachable, cap, self-demotion), `verify:ai-audit-revert`;
live: `verify:ai-model-live` (`NOT RUN` without pack). Cover runtime/model missing, checksum mismatch, timeout,
cancel, queue saturation, crash/restart, malformed output, schema rejection, injection text, shutdown.

## Acceptance

- App works unchanged with no runtime/model; renderer cannot run arbitrary prompts/processes.
- Autonomy policy + audit + revert exist and are verified; T3 unreachable.
- Model pack separate from installer; output constrained; permissions explicit.
- Benchmark recorded with a go/no-go decision.
